    Description = [[ The Two-degree Field (2dF) Survey was a project designed
        to map portions of the extragalactic universe. The 2dF instrument was
        mounted on the 3.9-meter (12.8-foot) Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT),
        located 450 km (280 miles) northwest of Sydney. The telescope has a
        two-degree field of view on the sky, enabling large parts of the sky to
        be observed at one time. For each pointing of the telescope, the
        instrument can acquire up to 400 spectra simultaneously via optical
        fibers that feed into two spectrographs. Each spectrograph sees light
        that is between 350 nm and 800 nm, spanning the visible spectrum.
        <br><br> The 2dF survey has three main components: the North Galactic
        Pole strip, the South Galactic Pole strip, and the random fields that
        surround the South Galactic Pole strip. The galaxy survey is composed
        of about 230,000 galaxies with brightness and redshift measurements. ]],
