    Description = [[ The Six-degree Field (6dF) Galaxy Survey mapped nearly half
     the sky from the Anglo-Australian Observatory. Unlike previous datasets,
     this one is not all-sky, meaning there are patches of sky that are not
     covered. In this case, the entire northern hemisphere has no coverage
     at all. This catalog overlaps with the Tully dataset, and there is a
     noticeable difference in the quality of these datasets. Tully is much
     tighter and the structure is more apparent, while the 6dF data are more
    spread out. This is because of local motions within galaxy clusters have
    not been corrected in these data. ]],
